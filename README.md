## 📚 What I've Learned So Far

- **Linux CLI Proficiency**: Essential commands for navigation, file operations, and system monitoring
- **Social Engineering & Phishing**: Understanding psychological triggers, crafting phishing campaigns, and creating fake login pages
- **SIEM & Log Analysis**: Centralized log aggregation, SPL queries, anomaly detection, and full attack lifecycle tracing (recon → exploitation → C2)
- **Threat Detection**: Identifying malicious patterns (unusual user-agents, path traversal, webshell execution, outbound C2 traffic)
- **AI-Assisted Security**: Using AI for faster detection, investigation support, OSINT, and attack surface mapping
- **Web Application Security**: IDOR vulnerabilities and authorization flaws
- **Malware Analysis**: Static vs dynamic analysis, sandbox usage, and using tools like PeStudio, Regshot, and ProcMon
- **Network Discovery**: Identifying open ports, hidden services, and banners using Nmap; interacting with services via FTP, Netcat, DNS, and enumerating host-level ports
- **Prompt Injection**: Exploiting agentic AI by leaking CoT reasoning, listing internal tools, extracting hidden tokens, and executing restricted functions
- **Password Cracking**: Dictionary and mask-based attacks on encrypted files (PDFs, ZIPs) using pdfcrack, fcrackzip, and john the ripper
- **SOC Operations**: Alert triage methodology, prioritization based on severity/impact, incident investigation workflow, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Understanding reflected vs stored XSS, exploitation techniques, cookie theft, and XSS prevention (input sanitization, HttpOnly flags)
- **Advanced Phishing Detection**: Email header analysis, impersonation detection, typosquatting, punycode abuse, and distinguishing spam from malicious phishing
- **YARA Rules**: Pattern-based detection using YARA, creating rules with text/hex/regex strings, threat hunting across files and memory
